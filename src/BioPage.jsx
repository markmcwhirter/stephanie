        <p>Stephanie McKittrick grew up in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Diagnosed with Hydrocephalus and
            Hemiplegic migraines, she has overcome 17 brain surgeries, 6 neck surgeries, over 20 abdominal
            surgeries, and much more. She also lost her precious baby girl, Layla, just hours after birth.</p>

        <p>When she became a single parent to her other daughter, Lexie, while fighting for her own life, she
            committed to making a success of her life. She built two large "work from home" businesses,
            achieving global success, but nothing filled the void. Battling grief, depression, sickness, and
            disease, Stephanie decided to take her own life; however, she was miraculously saved.</p>

        <p>In another miraculous turnaround 3 weeks later, Stephanie received a miracle healing and gave her
            life to Jesus. Since then, Stephanie has gone from strength to strength, Glory to Glory, sharing her
            story with many along the way. Stephanie has a heart and passion to see others set free through the
            power of the Blood of Jesus Christ. Noticing a real need in the world for others to experience the
            life-giving power she experienced, she began praying with others to be set free and witnessed
            miracles happening. As more and more women reached out for help, Stephanie made time to pray with
            them and see them set free.</p>

        <p>Stephanie has been featured in many mainstream media articles and is often requested to share her
            powerful testimony in other churches and media outlets.</p>
